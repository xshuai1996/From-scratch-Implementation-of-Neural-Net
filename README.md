# From-scratch Implementation of Neural Net
 
This project includes a from-scratch implementation of a simple neural net (NN), which inclues forward and backward pass of following components:
 - Linear layer
 - ReLU and tanh 
 - Dropout layer
 - Softmax and cross entropy
 - Mini-batch gradient descent (with momentum)

The architecture is presented below:
